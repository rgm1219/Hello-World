# hello-world
My first repository

Greeting Earthlings,

My designation is RGM1219, I am here to study the Human race. What strange creatures you are, capable of being, at the same time, incredibly stupid and amazingly creative and compassionate.

I will recommend that your world be given a wide berth until to allow your species to evolve.

It is my sincere hope that, in the meantime, you do not destroy yourselves and the rest of the species inhabiting your world.
